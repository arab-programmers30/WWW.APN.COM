                Plankton:-
            </h3>
            <p>
                Plankton (Ancient Greek πλανκτός / planktos) is a group of organisms that live in fresh and salty water.
                Often living suspended and apparently passively: gametes, larvae, animals unable to swim against the
                current (small crustaceans, plankton, jellyfish), microscopic plants and algae. Plankton or planktonic
                organisms are defined based on their ecological niche rather than taxonomic or phylogenetic criteria.
                Plankton is the foundation of many food webs. It is the main food of baleen whales, mussels, and
                oysters, but it can occasionally cause poisoning. Phytoplankton alone makes up about 50% of the organic
                matter produced on the planet, but it appears to be on a regular decline over the past 20 years.
                Zooplankton, with their vertical movements (cycles related to light and seasons), contribute to the
                mixing of aquatic layers, an aspect of natural mixing that has not been emphasized. Such phenomena also
                exist in fresh water (the movement of the water flea Daphnia, for example).

                Types of plankton:-
            </h3>
            <p>
                Plankton is divided into three main functional groups:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Phytoplankton: It lives near the surface of the water and depends on sunlight, where it obtains its
                    food through the process of photosynthesis.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Zooplankton: They feed on smaller groups of plankton, in addition to the eggs and larvae of other
                    organisms, such as small fish.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bacterial plankton: or bacterial plankton, which breaks down organic materials into inorganic
                    mineral materials
                </li>
            </ul>
            Monitoring phytoplankton in the oceans from space
            Green phytoplankton on Gotland, the largest of the Swedish islands (NASA)
            In early 2024, the US Space Agency (NASA) will launch the PACE satellite, which will monitor small
            phytoplankton in the oceans, from space, according to a report published on Friday by the US agency’s
            official website.
            Small phytoplankton are an important part of ocean ecosystems, and are essential to life on Earth as we know
            it, from producing the oxygen we breathe, to absorbing the carbon we emit, to feeding the fish we eat, and
            the new satellite will collect information about them using the devices it is equipped with.
            Instruments on the PACE satellite look at the ocean and collect data on the colors of light reflected from
            it, to tell where different types of phytoplankton flourish.
            The report says, “One of the satellite’s instruments, the Ocean Color Instrument, will be able to monitor
            more than 100 different wavelengths, making it the first scientific satellite to do this daily on a global
            scale. This hyperspectral instrument will make it possible to identify Phytoplankton by species for the
            first time from space.
            Phytoplankton float on the surface of the ocean and other bodies of water, like land plants, and use
            photosynthesis to absorb sunlight and carbon dioxide and generate oxygen and carbohydrates, which are sugars
            full of carbon. These sugars make phytoplankton the center of the ocean food web, as they feed large
            animals, from zooplankton. To shellfish, to finfish, which are then eaten by larger fish and marine mammals,
            and the formation of these sugars from sunlight is called primary production.
            Although phytoplankton make up less than 1 percent of Earth's total biomass that can photosynthesize, they
            provide about 45 percent of global primary production. Without phytoplankton, most ocean food webs would
            collapse, which would be devastating for both... Marine life and humans depend on fish for food.
            “Like plants on Earth, phytoplankton are very diverse, and each of these diverse species has different
            properties that allow them to take on different functions in Earth's carbon systems,” says Ivona Cetinich, a
            biological oceanographer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.
            Phytoplankton, such as Emiliana huxley, incorporate carbon into their shell-like outer shell, and when they
            die, they sink and trap the carbon in the depths of the ocean. Other types of phytoplankton capture carbon
            through the process of photosynthesis, and release the carbon back into the atmosphere in the form of carbon
            dioxide.
            “We hope that once the new satellite gives us a look at the diversity of phytoplankton in the oceans, it
            will tell us a lot about the global flow of carbon in the oceans, now and in the future,” Cetinich

            <p>
                Phytoplankton are found in all oceans around the world. Phytoplankton are simple organisms consisting
                mainly of algae, diatoms, cyanobacteria and other microscopic plant organisms that photosynthesize using
                sunlight and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen and energy.
                These plankton live throughout the oceans, including the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, South Atlantic,
                Arctic, and Antarctic oceans. The presence of these phytoplankton plays a crucial role in providing
                oxygen to marine organisms and in the balance of the marine environment in general, and they are a
                source of food for many marine organisms.
