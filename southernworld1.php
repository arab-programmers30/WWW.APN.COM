                Introduction:
            </h3>
            <p>
                The Southern Ocean was a globally recognized body of water. <br>
                The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognized this in 1937, but reversed the decision in
                1953 due to controversy over the exact boundaries of the oceans, according to National Geographic. <br>
                But scientists have long known about the Southern Ocean, and have confirmed that its unique qualities
                make it a distinct body of water with its own environmental and conservation concerns. <br>
                The largest marine protected area in the world is located in the Southern Ocean, in the Ross Sea, and
                was formed to protect the nutrient-rich waters that support... Krill (the most important ocean organism
                in the upper food chain is the small shrimp-like krill), plankton, penguins, whales, etc. <br>
                It is also called the Antarctic Ocean, it covers about one-sixteenth of the total ocean area on Earth.
                <br>
                The Southern Ocean consists of parts of the global ocean, the South Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean,
                the Indian Ocean, and their tributary seas surrounding Antarctica below 60 degrees south latitude. <br>
                It is not cut off from any other continental landmass. <br>
                Its narrowest passage is the Drake Passage, which is 600 miles (about 1,000 km) wide, between South
                America and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. <br>
                In terms of "area", the Arctic Ocean is Only he is smaller. <br>
                The Southern Ocean covers 8,479,000 square miles (21,960,000 square km), it contains 17,226,000 cubic
                miles (71,800,000 cubic kilometers) of water. <br>
                Its average depth is 10,728 feet (3,270 m). <br>
                It has a maximum depth of 24,383 feet (7,432 m) in the South Sandwich Trench (3,270 m), southeast of
                South Georgia Island.
                Most oceans are bordered by continents, and this continent surrounds Antarctica and is bordered by three
                other oceans. <br>
                But the waters of the Southern Ocean are not just an extension of those oceans. <br>
                What makes the Southern Ocean so special is due in large part to the Antarctic Circumpolar Current
                (ACC), a 34-million-year-old current that is cooler and less salty than the waters immediately north of
                it. <br>
                These properties make ACC a powerful engine for global water and heat cycling.

            </h3>
            <p>
                The Antarctic Circumpolar Currents are always moving eastward - chasing and joining themselves at 21,000
                km (13,000 mi) in length - and include the world's longest ocean current, transporting 130 million cubic
                meters (4.6 billion cubic feet) of water per second - 100 times more than the flow of rivers, The whole
                world.

            <h3>
                The climate:
            </h3>
            <p>
                Sea temperatures vary from approximately -2 to 10 degrees Celsius (28 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit). <br>
                Hurricanes move eastward around the continent, often becoming intense due to the difference in
                temperature between the ice and the open ocean. <br>
                The ocean is located at latitude 40 south towards the Antarctic Circle, which has the strongest average
                winds of any place on Earth. <br>
                The ocean freezes in winter beyond 65°S in the Pacific sector and 55°S in the Atlantic sector, and
                surface temperatures fall well below 0°C. <br>
                Constant strong winds inland keep some coastal points free of ice throughout winter season. <br>
                In strong winds, that's why no one lived on the continent.

            <p>
                Between July 1, 1998 and June 30, 1999, the fish catch amounted to 119,898 tons, of which 85% consisted
                of krill and 14% of toothfish. <br>
                International agreements came into force in late 1999 to limit illegal, undeclared and unregulated
                fishing, which in the 1998-1999 season caught 5 to 6 times more toothfish than regulated fishing.

                Severe cracks in a four-season ice pier at McMurdo Station slowed shipping operations in 1983 and proved
