                What affects productivity in the ocean?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Ocean productivity. Abiotic factors such as solar radiation and nutrients and biotic factors such as
                predation by zooplankton may influence ocean primary productivity. Productivity varies depending on the
                season, as well as both locally and globally.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Where is productivity in the ocean greatest?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Higher chlorophyll concentrations and increased productivity were generally observed at the equator,
                along coasts (particularly eastern margins), and in high-altitude oceans (Fig. 4a and b).
            </p>
            <h3>
                What are the most productive ocean environments? Why?
            </h3>
            <p>
                The world's most productive waters are found in areas of high water levels. Jumping water in coastal
                waters brings nutrients toward the surface. Phytoplankton reproduce rapidly in these conditions, and
                zooplankton reproduce to graze and provide an abundant food supply for the nekton.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Why is the ocean so low in productivity?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Sunlight is the main limiting factor in the oceans. As the depth of the ocean increases, the intensity
                of light decreases, reducing the rate of photosynthesis. This decrease in the rate of photosynthesis
                will eventually lead to a decrease in the growth of plants and animals thriving in the aquatic
                environment.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Why are coral reefs so productive?
            </h3>
            <p>
                The high productivity of corals is mainly attributed to the photosynthesis between the coral animal and
                algae of the Symbiodiniaceae family, recognizing that the host can increase algal photosynthesis by
                concentrating nutrients and enhancing light absorption efficiency.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Why are oceans so low in productivity?
            </h3>
            <p>
                In the ocean, sunlight is the main limiting factor that reduces the rate of photosynthesis. ... Minerals
                and nutrients can also be a dampening factor based on the location of the oceans, so there will be less
                productivity from land which is 170 billion tons compared to the 55 billion tons ion of the oceans.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Why are cold oceans more productive?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Where phytoplankton grows depends on available sunlight, temperature, and nutrient levels. Phytoplankton
                tend to be more abundant where the water is cold because cold water tends to contain more nutrients than
                warm water.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Why are the oceans a major contributor to the planet's net productivity on a global scale?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Net ecosystem production from the oceans represents the sinking of dead organisms and detritus through
                the water column. ...This accumulation represents long-term activity of a biological pump, while the
                continuous flow of deep water returns dissolved carbon to the ocean surface and atmosphere.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Why does the ocean around Antarctica have such high biological productivity?
            </h3>
            <p>
                What makes the Antarctic Ocean so rich in life? There are three reasons: long hours of daylight in the
                Antarctic summer to help algae grow, turbulent water that keeps nutrients floating in the water where
                phytoplankton can reach them, and extremely cold water.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Are coral reefs highly producti?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Coral reefs are some of the most productive ecosystems on the planet, with primary producers at the base
                of the food chain (including corals) supporting their complex food webs.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Why do you think coral reefs have higher productivity than the open ocean?
            </h3>
            <p>
                In general, rates of biological productivity along continental margins are much higher than in the open
                ocean. This is due to a variety of factors including upwelling of nutrient-rich coastal waters and
                nutrient inputs from continental runoff.
            </p>
            <h3>
                How to increase productivity in aquatic ecosystems?
            </h3>
            <p>
                On land, it is driven by temperature and the availability of water and nutrients modified by land
                use. In aquatic ecosystems, primary productivity is driven by the availability of nutrients and light,
                and to a lesser extent temperature and other factors.
